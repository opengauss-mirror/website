The openGauss Community understands the importance of your privacy and fully respects it. <u>**Please read this openGauss Community Privacy Statement ("Statement") carefully before you submit your personal data to us.**</u> If you have any questions about how we process your personal data, please feel free to contact us. Unless otherwise specified, "we" and "us" in this Statement refers to the openGauss Community.

## 1.How We Collect and Process Your Personal Data

**We generally do not require your personal data if you only browse the general content of the openGauss Community ("Community"). We will collect your personal data accordingly in the following circumstances:**

- (a) **Account Service**. The openGauss community provides the openGauss community account service for unified identity and permission management. When you register an openGauss community account, we will collect your mobile number for identity verification. We will also use your email address to verify your identity in the community and collect statistics based on the data so that we can understand the operating status of the openGauss community platform. We may collect your nickname, profile picture, and company name in the user center and display the data in the community.

- (b) **Mail Subscription**. When you use our mail subscription service, we will collect your <u>**email address and name (optional)**</u>. We will provide you with the email subscription service through this email address to facilitate your participation in discussions in the community.

- (c) **Service Optimization**. To continuously understand the operating status of the openGauss Community and provide better services for you, we will deploy a third-party plugin in this program. The third-party plugin will collect and record information on your browser, computer, and mobile device, including but not limited to your <u>**IP address, access source, number of visits to the community, stay duration, access timestamp, browser type, and server type and version**</u>, etc. This will form the basis of our analysis, which helps us to better understand the openGauss Community operation.

- (d) **Contributor License Agreement Signing**. When you participate in code contribution through the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA") signing system (click [<u>here</u>](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/Z2l0ZWUlMkZvcGVuZ2F1c3M=) to learn more), you need to submit your relevant personal data to the CLA signing system. We will obtain such personal data to verify whether you have signed the CLA, and to conduct relevant statistical analysis to understand how the community is operating.

- (e) **Meeting Service**. When you use our meeting service, we will collect your Gitee ID, SIG group name, and (optional) email address for configuring related permissions. You can choose whether to record the meeting. If you agree to record the meeting, we will upload the meeting video to the third-party platform Bilibili (https://www.bilibili.com/) so that more interested individuals or organizations can participate in your meeting.

- (f) **Certificate Service**. When using our certificate query service, you need to enter your email address to query your OGCA certificate in the openGauss community. We will collect your personal information from our partner to generate an OGCA certificate.

We may also collect your personal information from third parties, including other platforms or communities, within the scope of your authorization and consent, or obtain your personal information from other legal and public channels. We promise to process your personal information in strict accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Please read the privacy policies and user agreements of the third parties carefully. If your personal information provided by a third party is required when you use the openGauss community, but you refuse to allow the third party to collect, use, transfer, or share your personal information when the third party provides services, you may not be able to use related services of the openGauss community. For example, when you use an authorized third-party account to log in to the openGauss community, we will obtain your personal information from the third party with your consent.
