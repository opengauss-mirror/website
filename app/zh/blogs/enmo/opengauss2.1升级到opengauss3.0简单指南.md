# opengauss2.1 升级到 opengauss3.0 简单指南

本文出处：[https://www.modb.pro/db/391240](https://www.modb.pro/db/391240)

本文记录升级中主要步骤，生产中升级需要做很多的准备工作，主要步骤具体参考官方的升级指南https://opengauss.org/zh/blogs/blogs.html?post/shine/opengauss%E5%8D%87%E7%BA%A7%E6%8C%87%E5%AF%BC%E4%B9%A6/

## 1.root 用户登录节点，创建升级目录

```
[zf@mogdb-kernel-0003 dblink]$ gsql -d postgres -p 15400 -r
gsql ((openGauss 2.1.0 build 590b0f8e) compiled at 2021-09-30 14:29:27 commit 0 last mr  )
Non-SSL connection (SSL connection is recommended when requiring high-security)
Type "help" for help.
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 dblink]$ mkdir -p /opt/software/gaussdb_upgrade
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 dblink]$ cd /opt/software/gaussdb_upgrade
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]$ ls
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]$

```

## 2.下载升级包，并解压

下载地址:https://opengauss.org/zh/download/

```
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]# wget https://opengauss.obs.cn-south-1.myhuaweicloud.com/3.0.0/arm/openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-all.tar.gz
openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-all.tar.gz 100%[======================================================================================>] 107.10M  2.63MB/s    in 27s
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]# ls
openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-all.tar.gz
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]# tar -xf openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-all.tar.gz
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]# ls
openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-all.tar.gz  openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-om.sha256  openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit.tar.bz2
openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-cm.sha256   openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-om.tar.gz  upgrade_sql.sha256
openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-cm.tar.gz   openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit.sha256     upgrade_sql.tar.gz
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 gaussdb_upgrade]# tar -xf openGauss-3.0.0-openEuler-64bit-om.tar.gz

```

## 3.进去升级目录，执行升级安装

```
cd /opt/software/gaussdb_upgrade/script
[root@mogdb-kernel-0003 script]# ./gs_preinstall -U zf -G zf  -X /data1/softwarezf/mogdb/clusterconfig.xml

```

## 4.执行就地升级或者灰度升级

就地升级：升级期间需停止业务进行，一次性升级所有节点。

```
gs_upgradectl -t auto-upgrade -X   /data1/softwarezf/mogdb/clusterconfig.xml
```

灰度升级：灰度升级支持全业务操作，也是一次性升级所有节点。

```
gs_upgradectl -t auto-upgrade -X /opt/software/GaussDB_Kernel/clusterconfig.xml --grey
```

切换至数据库用户，我这里是 zf,执行升级操作，这里采用就地升级

```
[zf@mogdb-kernel-0003 ~]$ gs_upgradectl -t auto-upgrade -X   /data1/softwarezf/mogdb/clusterconfig.xml

```

## 5.检查升级是否成功

```
[zf@mogdb-kernel-0003 ~]$ gsql -d postgres -p 15400 -r
gsql ((openGauss 3.0.0 build 02c14696) compiled at 2022-04-01 18:12:00 commit 0 last mr  )
Non-SSL connection (SSL connection is recommended when requiring high-security)
Type "help" for help.
openGauss=#

```

## 6.进行提交升级或者回滚

一旦提交操作完成，则不能再执行回滚操作。

```
gs_upgradectl -t commit-upgrade  -X  /data1/softwarezf/mogdb/clusterconfig.xml
[zf@mogdb-kernel-0003 ~]$ gs_upgradectl -t commit-upgrade -X /data1/softwarezf/mogdb/clusterconfig.xml

openGauss=#

```

强制回滚，如果数据库异常，可强制回滚

```
 gs_upgradectl -t auto-rollback -X /opt/software/GaussDB_Kernel/clusterconfig.xml
```
